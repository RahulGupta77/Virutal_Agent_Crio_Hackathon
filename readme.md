### Project Context:
The objective of this project is to develop a chatbot that enhances the learning experience by:
- Providing answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) from each module to reduce the ticket count for repetitive doubts.
- Ensuring the chatbot is context-specific within the scope of each sprint.
- Guiding learners with hints rather than providing direct solutions.

### Technologies Used:

| **Category** | **Technologies** |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Frontend** | TypeScript, React.js, Context API, Axios, Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend**  | Express.js, MongoDB, CORS, Node.js |
| **LLMs and Backend** | Flask, Langchain, Hugging Face Embeddings, FAISS Vector DB, GooglePalm (as LLM) |


### Implementation:
We implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based agent to handle FAQs for Qkart and the sales team. The model was deployed locally using Flask. 

### Usage: 
- Access the frontend application via your browser.
- Interact with the chatbot to get FAQs related to Qkart and sales.
- The chatbot will provide hints and guide the learners through their questions without providing direct solutions.

### Acknowledgments:
We thank the Crio.do team for organizing this hackathon and providing us with this learning opportunity.
